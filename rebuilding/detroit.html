      <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
      <p>
        You don’t rebuild quietly in Detroit. You do it loud — with basslines under your feet, murals in your eyeline, and the hum of something being fixed just out of view. This city doesn’t hand you comfort. It hands you tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s beauty here, but not the delicate kind. It’s forged — from vinyl and concrete, from food trucks and gospel choirs. Detroit doesn’t pity your brokenness. It recognizes it. And then it gets to work beside you.

      <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
      <p>
        Detroit is a city that doesn't erase its scars — it paints over them in neon. If you've felt erased, silenced, or shattered, Detroit won’t fix you — it’ll show you how to build next to the damage. Beat by beat. Brick by brick. And it’ll hand you the hammer while you do it.
