  <h1>Detroit, Michigan</h1>

  <p>Rebuilding isn’t always quiet. Sometimes it’s loud — made of basslines, paint streaks, and the stubborn beat of something that won’t stay broken. Detroit doesn’t whisper you forward. It hands you the hammer.</p>

  <p>The streets carry stories in murals. Abandoned factories bloom with music and ideas. Someone’s always fixing an engine. Someone’s always planting kale in an empty lot. You can hear Motown from a passing car, and it sounds like belief.</p>

  <p>Detroit doesn’t ask you to forget the past. It shows you how to stand next to it and build anyway. Brick by brick. Beat by beat.</p>
