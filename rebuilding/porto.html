  <h1>Porto, Portugal</h1>

  <p>Some places don’t demand change. They just hold space while you change yourself. Porto is one of them — a city that lets you linger, listen, and loosen your grip on what hurt.</p>

  <p>You wander through cobalt-tiled facades and steep stone alleys, the scent of pastry and river air following close. A tram groans uphill. A seagull laughs. Somewhere, fado plays — half sorrow, half surrender. It matches your mood.</p>

  <p>Here, you don’t have to rush to rebuild. You just have to arrive, breathe, and let Porto remind you that beauty still happens. Even now. Even here.</p>
