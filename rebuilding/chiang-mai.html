  <h1>Chiang Mai, Thailand</h1>

  <p>You don't need to start over loudly. Chiang Mai understands that healing is a soft discipline — one built from bowls of rice, temple bells, and the quiet dignity of daily rhythm.</p>

  <p>Here, the mornings are slow and golden. Monks walk barefoot through backstreets as steam rises from street-side tea stalls. The air smells of lemongrass and woodsmoke. There’s space for silence. There’s time to notice.</p>

  <p>In Chiang Mai, rebuilding isn't a task. It's a texture. And slowly, without trying, you find yourself whole again — simply by being here.</p>
