      <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
      <p>Kotor doesn’t shout. It hums. A medieval bay town wrapped in mountains and mirror-still water, it invites the overwhelmed to slow down — really slow down. You’ll wander alleys too narrow for urgency, pass churches that have outlived empires, and sit at cafés where no one’s in a rush. There’s Wi-Fi, sure. But you won’t need it. Kotor speaks in echoes and stillness, not alerts.</p>

      <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
      <p>Kotor is made for the soul that needs silence but doesn’t want to feel alone. It doesn’t fix your overstimulation—it soothes it, like a dark chapel on a hot day. Cool, ancient, and waiting for you to hear yourself again.</p>
