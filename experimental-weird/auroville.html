      <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
      <p>If the world has been screaming at you in headlines, notifications, and expectations — Auroville is a volume knob. It turns the noise down to almost nothing. Here, amid the banyan trees and experimental architecture, you're not asked to achieve or react. You’re invited to inquire. This international township offers both spiritual sanctuary and communal experimentation — a space not to escape life, but to face it gently, without the static.</p>

      <h2>🧭 Essentials</h2>

      <h2>🌿 Hidden Gravity</h2>
      <p>This isn’t a place for escape. It’s a place for re-tuning. Auroville reminds you that not every thought requires a reaction, not every signal needs attention. Here, you’re not unplugging from the world — you’re reconnecting with something deeper beneath it.</p>
