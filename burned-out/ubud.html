      <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
      <p>Ubud doesn't ask anything of you. It just <em>receives</em>. Nestled among rice paddies and slow-breathing jungle, this is a town where burnout dissolves by degrees — not with fanfare, but with space. The air is thick with calm. The bells from the temple don’t ring for tourists; they ring for time itself. If your nervous system has forgotten how to be still, Ubud remembers.</p>

      <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
      <p>Ubud is a place of feminine stillness—not in gendered terms, but in <em>yin</em>: the pause, the nurture, the breath between striving. This is where exhausted creatives, caretakers, and overthinkers learn that healing is not doing—it’s undoing. The jungle absorbs what you no longer need to carry.</p>
