    <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
    <p>
      Valle de Bravo doesn’t demand attention—it restores it. Nestled in the pine-covered highlands of central Mexico, this lakeside town is where the noise ends. You’ll wake to church bells and wind in the trees. The fog will lift, inside and out. This is not escape—it’s reconnection.
