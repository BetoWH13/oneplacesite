    <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
    <p>
      Kyoto doesn’t scream. It whispers. If the world has worn you thin, Kyoto gives you back your edges—quietly. Between the moss-draped stones of its temples and the rhythmic hush of bamboo forests, your breath will slow again. You don’t need to plan your healing. Just show up. The stillness will do the rest.

    <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
    <p>
      Kyoto is built on cycles. Seasons, rituals, silence and return. Beneath its serene exterior is a gravitational pull for those who’ve lost their rhythm. It doesn’t fix you—it recalibrates you. One breath, one stone step at a time.
