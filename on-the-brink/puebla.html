      <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
      <p>Puebla is not chaotic—but it’s not static either. It’s composed, colorful, and quietly powerful. If you’re on the cusp of something—new identity, new chapter, new you—this city offers you a mirror wrapped in beauty. The rhythm is deliberate, the architecture reflective, the food a meditation. You’ll recalibrate here—not with force, but with grace.</p>

      <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
      <p>Puebla is the threshold between your old self and the one emerging. It doesn’t push. It offers stillness, structure, and saturated hues—so you can feel the shift within without losing your center. This is the quiet before your next act.</p>
