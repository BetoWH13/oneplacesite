        <h2>✨ Why Here, For You, Now</h2>
        <p>The Isle of Skye is where the restlessness inside you meets its match in nature’s own feral poetry. Jagged cliffs, endless sea spray, and mists that hide and reveal what you’re meant to find. It’s not a checklist destination. It’s an unraveling. Perfect for someone whose compass doesn’t point to calm, but to movement, myth, and meaning.</p>

        <h2>🧭 Essentials</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Best time:</strong> Late spring to early autumn</li>
          <li><strong>Visa:</strong> UK visa or visa-free for many passports</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural notes:</strong> Respect weather shifts and silence; the locals are kind but private.</li>
          <li><strong>Typical day:</strong> Drive single-track roads to remote beaches, hike the Quiraing, sip whisky in a stone cottage.</li>

        <h2>🌀 Hidden Gravity</h2>
        <p>Skye seduces through silence and sky. Its hidden pull lies in the way it mirrors your longing without offering an answer. It’s for those who seek windswept freedom more than resolution. A place that teaches you how to stay with uncertainty — and love it.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>⛑ If Infeasible</h2>
        <p>If Skye is out of reach, try Ireland’s Dingle Peninsula or Norway’s Lofoten Islands for similarly wind-whipped solitude and mythic terrain.</p>
