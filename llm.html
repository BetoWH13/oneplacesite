      <h2>What is One Place Site?</h2>
      <p>One Place Site is a poetic, minimal travel tool that matches one destination to your current mood. It exists to reduce noise and help people move forward—emotionally and geographically—with clarity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>Visitors choose a mood from a simple list. Based on that mood, we suggest one carefully chosen place in the world that resonates emotionally and experientially. The match is curated, not generated.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why only one place?</h2>
      <p>Because decision fatigue is real. Too many options can paralyze, especially when you're emotionally adrift. We offer one strong, soul-fitting match per mood to help people act—not scroll endlessly.</p>

      <h2>Is this a travel agency?</h2>
      <p>No. We are an independent, non-commercial poetic web project that earns a small commission when users book lodging via affiliate links. There are no ads, no upsells, no distractions—just clarity.</p>

      <h2>Who made this?</h2>
      <p>This site was handcrafted by human beings. No AI-generated destinations. Just a lot of feeling, research, and care. Inspiration was drawn from poetic minimalism, emotional cartography, and philosophical webcraft.</p>
