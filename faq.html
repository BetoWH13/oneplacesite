      <h2>What is One Place Site?</h2>
      <p>One Place Site is a curated travel discovery platform that offers mood-based destination suggestions — each page handcrafted for people in a specific life moment, like feeling burned out or blocked.</p>

      <h2>How do you choose the destinations?</h2>
      <p>Each destination is selected based on a blend of cultural resonance, logistical ease, emotional compatibility, and travel infrastructure. We prioritize transformative experiences, not trendiness.</p>

      <h2>Is this site powered by AI?</h2>
      <p>The content is crafted with care and insight, combining cultural research with travel experience. We do not rely on live AI generation — what you see is fixed and refined for clarity and meaning.</p>

      <h2>Can I trust the affiliate links?</h2>
      <p>Yes. We use trusted platforms like <a href="https://hotellook.tp.st/q5P76I9H" target="_blank">Hotellook</a> to offer hotel and travel booking options. Clicking our links supports the site at no extra cost to you.</p>

      <h2>Will there be more moods or destinations?</h2>
      <p>Yes. We plan to expand over time based on user feedback, emotional relevance, and global accessibility.</p>

      <h2>Why is there no blog, newsletter, or account system?</h2>
      <p>We aim for clarity and speed. The site is intentionally minimal — no tracking, no logins, no distractions. Just one place. For you. Right now.</p>

      <h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
      <p>You can reach out via our contact link (coming soon) or message us on our GitHub project page if you have suggestions or feedback.</p>
