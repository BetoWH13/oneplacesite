# 🌍 One Place Site

**Website:** [one-place-site.xyz](https://one-place-site.xyz)  
**Repo Purpose:** A fast, lightweight, hand-curated travel recommendation site based on mood-driven destination discovery.

## ✨ About
This project offers a single, meaningful answer to a timeless question:
> "Where should I go next—right now, in this moment of my life?"

Without AI APIs, logins, or distractions, users pick a life situation (like *burned-out*, *restless*, *grieving*) and receive three places selected for personal transformation.

All recommendations are handcrafted and optimized for clarity, speed, and spiritual relevance.

## 🧭 Structure
- `index.html` — Mood selector homepage
- `/burned-out/` — Contains 3 pages: `ubud.html`, `kyoto.html`, `valle-de-bravo.html`, and an `index.html`
- Future folders will match other moods: `/restless/`, `/blocked/`, etc.
- `style.css` — Shared minimalist stylesheet

## 💼 Monetization
Affiliate links powered by [Travelpayouts](https://www.travelpayouts.com) using links like:
```

Each destination page includes a lodging affiliate button.

## 🚀 Deployment
This site is deployed via **Netlify** from a GitHub repository. No dynamic backend. No build tools. Just clean, simple HTML/CSS.

## 🔒 Philosophy
- No AI-generated answers in real-time (everything is prewritten)
- No tracking cookies, pop-ups, or signup forms
- Blazing fast load time for modern and low-end devices
